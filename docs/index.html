          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I've been working in information technology professionally since
            2009, and I've been in software engineering since 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether I'm working on something for fellow team members or for
            end-users, I strive above all to design systems that are intuitive
            to understand, well considered and thoughtful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in the history of computer technology, its uses in
            urbanism, the arts, and the ways in which it affects culture and
            society.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Working as part of the engineering leadership team to improve
                  our developer experience, code standards and overall team
                  productivity - being responsible, in particular, for decisions
                  about frameworks, tooling, libraries and standards on the
                  front-end.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enhancing invoicing and financial integration systems to allow
                  for multi-national corporations to comply with local tax
                  codes. This project included multiple iterations of
                  requirement solicitation from disparate accounting teams and
                  going straight to source regulations to develop a deeper
                  understanding where necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implementing Multi-factor Authentication for an internal
                  application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintaining a Ruby on Rails codebase with a long history,
                  committing to modernising systems even when it poses a
                  significant technical challenge.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Leading a team that built a graphical interface to an
                  investment management API. This included a Next.JS front-end,
                  an Azure Functions (serverless) backend and GraphQL
                  communicating between the two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participating in the development of a PWA for client
                  onboarding that ran completely offline on a tablet. Data was
                  stored locally in an encrypted manner and synced to a server
                  when connectivity was available. Key contributions included
                  developing a strategy to download and cache the software
                  locally once updates were deployed, developing a migration
                  strategy to keep stored data in sync with the expectations of
                  the software, and streamlining the sync process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assisting with the migration from a fully in-office
                  organization to a remote-only organization for the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Part of this work included configuring Entra Domain
                  Services (Azure AD DS at the time) and LDAP authentication for
                  an on-premises firewall for VPN authentication using users'
                  Azure accounts with no local server.
